    "# Business Understanding \n",
    "\n",
    "## Background & context\n",
    "Kenya is a continental leader in clean electricity, with high shares of geothermal, hydro, wind and solar in its generation mix. EPRA’s latest statistics show renewables dominate annual generation (approx. 83% in 2023), with geothermal the single largest source; recent reports also note record peak demand rising from ~2,177MW (2024) to ~2,316MW (2025) evidence of a growing, weather-sensitive grid that must balance maintenance, load growth, and climate variability. Meanwhile, access to electricity in Kenya has climbed to ~76% (2023), but reliability for end-users remains uneven and costly for SMEs and social services. Across Sub-Saharan Africa, progress on universal access has stalled and financing needs far exceed current commitments, keeping reliability and affordability under pressure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kenya also experiences episodic widespread outages (e.g., Dec 18 2024, multi-hour blackout affecting most of the country), underscoring the value of weather-aware preparedness and better translation of utility maintenance plans into actionable risk for businesses and counties. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem statement\n",
    "Today, customers receive planned-maintenance notices that outline where/when power will be interrupted, but they rarely get hour-by-hour risk probabilities, nor clear “what to do now” recommendations tailored to their operations. Weather, vegetation conditions and historical patterns can extend or exacerbate outage windows (e.g., storms delaying restoration) or increase grid stress even when no notice is present. Businesses, clinics and telecom sites need a localized, short-horizon risk signal and simple, low-cost actions to reduce losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overall objective (MVP)\n",
    "Develop a predictive model that forecasts county-level grid-stress / outage risk 6–24 hours ahead using weather conditions, vegetation proxies, historical outage patterns, and available consumption signal , and a small recommender that converts “high-risk windows” into top 2–3 actions per user persona (e.g., SME, cold-chain), with brief, auditable reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SMART objectives \n",
    "1. Model performance:Train a county-hour classifier achieving PR-AUC ≥ 0.4  and Recall ≥ 0.60 at a 5% alert budge  on a held-out recent period (time-based split).  \n",
    "2. Calibration & validity: Deliver Brier score ≤ 0.2  and include 2–3 face-validity backtest  around notable national outage days to show external relevance (plots only; no training leakage). \n",
    "3. Productization: Deploy a minimal Streamlit app that displays next-6/12/24h risk by county and returns Top-3 action per persona with reason codes (e.g., “planned window + rain_24h↑ + wind_max_24h↑”).  \n",
    "4. Data quality & lineage: Produce a reproducible pipeline with versioned datasets (labels_admin_hourly, features_weather_hourly, training_matrix ) ensuring no duplicate (county, hour  rows and Africa/Nairobi timestamps end-to-end).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metrics of success\n",
    "- Discrimination  PR-AUC on held-out period; Recall@  where *k* equals 5% alert rate (operational budgeted alarms).  \n",
    "- Calibration Brier score and reliability curve.  \n",
    "- Coverage & latency  % of counties with valid hourly predictions; daily pipeline runtime within target.  \n",
    "- Actionability % of high-risk windows for which the app proposes at least one low-cost action; qualitative feedback from 1–2 case-study sites (Athi River, Garissa).  \n",
    "- Explainability Global feature importances + per-prediction reason snippets aligned to engineering features (e.g., CAPE/precipitation rollups, wind gust maxima, vegetation proxy).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Targeted stakeholders & users\n",
    "- Primary users   \n",
    "  - SMEs / manufacturers / cold-chain operator "
